Hierarchy
---------------
Need a way to sort the fanfiction
-Fandom
-Author
-Category (time travel, redo, post ootp etc...) just a string
-Dates - update date, download date, publish date - When the author was last active
-Sequels->Some kind of pointer to stories that are related either as sequels or the same story or whatever
-word count
-review count
-favourites
-follows
-hits
-chapter count
-Summary
-A version with and without authors notes, or addendum to story with links in chapter to the notes.
-Library with grammar score?
-Personal rating
-tags
-story id/url
-----------------------------------------------
User Interface
-----------------------
-Get things done quickly
-Keyboard shortcuts that make sense
-Categorizing new stories (automatic categorization?)
-Store metadata information in the epubs themselves
-diffs between local and phone library
-rescan/check for updates
-Process a collection of uncategorized stories
-Tree directory structure
-Look at incoming stories or existing stories(two tabs dockable?) or just two buttons to swap between

---------------------------------
epub analyzer
- look at a file, categorize it
- summary page if exists replace with our own (like what flag used to generate)
- Fandom book cover if none.
- Option for custom book cover
- Create epub file from story data
